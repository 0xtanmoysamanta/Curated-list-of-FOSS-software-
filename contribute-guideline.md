## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### For Adding New Tools

#### ✅ What Makes a Good Addition?

A tool should be:
- **Free and Open Source** (FOSS) - The code must be freely available
- **Actively Maintained** - Regular updates within the last 12 months
- **Widely Used** - Has significant adoption in the developer community
- **Relevant** - Directly useful for software engineers' daily work
- **Documented** - Has clear documentation for users

#### ❌ What We Generally Don't Accept

- **Proprietary software** (even if free to use)
- **Abandoned projects** (no updates in 2+ years)
- **Niche tools** with very limited use cases
- **Forks without significant improvements** over the original
- **Tools still in early alpha** without proven stability

### Formatting Guidelines

When adding a tool, please follow this format:

```markdown
**Tool Name** emoji  
*Brief one-line description (under 80 characters)*
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**htop** 📊  
*Interactive process viewer for Unix systems*
```

#### Emoji Guidelines
- Choose an emoji that represents the tool's function
- Keep it fun but relevant
- Don't repeat emojis too often in the same category
